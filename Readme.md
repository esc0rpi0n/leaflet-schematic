# Leaflet schematics

This is a set of tools to display and work with non-cartographic large
high-detailed SVG schematics or blueprints. The problem is that if you want to
work with the SVG as with image overlay, several technical limitations and
performance issues strike in:
* you cannot work on larger scales with the whole canvas because of the
  dimension restrictions of browsers
* you have to scale the drawing initially to fit the viewport on the certain
  zoom level
